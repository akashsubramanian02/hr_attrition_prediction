👨‍💼 HR Attrition & Performance Prediction System
End-to-End Machine Learning + Streamlit + Python Project

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting:

✔ Employee Attrition
✔ Employee Performance Rating
✔ Employee Promotion Likelihood

Using real-world style HR data and an end-to-end pipeline involving:

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

Python preprocessing

Machine Learning Model training

Pickle model export

Streamlit Web Application (.py)

✅ Step-by-Step Process
1. Created the Jupyter Notebook (hr_prediction.ipynb)
➤ Loaded the Employee Dataset

Using Pandas:

Checked shape, column info, and datatypes

Displayed initial few rows

Identified numeric & categorical features

2. Performed Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

✔ Removed null values
✔ Cleaned categorical columns
✔ Encoded binary columns like:

OverTime → Yes/No

Gender → Male/Female
✔ One-hot encoded JobRole, MaritalStatus, BusinessTravel
✔ Selected 12–15 best features for modeling
✔ Standardized numeric values using StandardScaler
✔ Split dataset into train & test sets

Created final X (features) and y (target) for:

Targets:

Attrition (Yes/No → 1/0)

PerformanceRating

Promotion (YearsSinceLastPromotion based synthetic label)

3. Machine Learning Model Training

Built and tested multiple ML models:

🔹 Logistic Regression
🔹 KNN Classifier
🔹 Decision Tree
🔹 Random Forest (best performer)

Performed:

Accuracy evaluation

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC score

Confusion matrix

Hyperparameter tuning for RandomForest

Achieved 88–90% accuracy using selected features.

4. Exported Models & Scalers Using Pickle

Saved best models:

attrition_model.pkl
performance_model.pkl
promotion_model.pkl
scaler.pkl
performance_scaler.pkl
promotion_scaler.pkl


These models are used inside the Streamlit application for real-time prediction.

5. Built the Streamlit Application (hr_prediction.py)

Created a full navigation-based dashboard with 4 pages:

📊 Home Dashboard

Shows useful insights:

High Risk Employees

High Job Satisfaction group

High Performance employees

🔮 Attrition Prediction Page

Clean aligned UI

User enters employee details

Features auto-encoded and scaled

Model predicts whether employee will leave

Displays processed input dataframe

📈 Performance Rating Prediction Page

Predicts employee performance (1–4)

Uses performance model & scaler

Shows input preview table

🎓 Promotion Likelihood Prediction Page

Predicts if employee will be promoted

Uses synthetic Promotion label

Displays input dataframe

Streamlit app also includes:

✔ Sidebar menu
✔ Clean UI alignment
✔ Data previews for each section
✔ Error-free preprocessing pipeline
